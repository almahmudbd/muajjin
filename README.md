## Overview

**Muajjin** is a lightweight, privacy-friendly Islamic Salat & Saum times app built with modern web technologies and packaged as a native Android application using Capacitor.

Times are calculated locally on the device—no tracking, no remote APIs required.

## Philosophy

This app is designed with a **minimal feature philosophy**. The focus is intentionally narrow:

- ✅ Salat times
- ✅ Saum times (Suhoor/Iftar)

Any additional features beyond these core functions will **not** be implemented. The goal is to keep the app simple, lightweight, and focused on its essential purpose.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
bun run build
```

---

## Android Build

<details>
<summary><strong>Signing, APK Build, and Reproducible Verification</strong></summary>

### Keystore Setup

Only required if you want to produce a signed `release` APK yourself.

1. Place your keystore file in:

```
android/app/
```

2. Create or edit `android/local.properties`:

```properties
keystore.file=app/your-keystore.keystore
keystore.password=your_password
keystore.key.alias=your_alias
keystore.key.password=your_key_password
```

### Build APK

```bash
# Debug APK (larger, faster build)
bun run android:build

# Release APK (optimized, smaller)
bun run android:release

# GitHub Release APK (includes update checker)
bun run android:release:github
```

**APK Output Directory**

```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/
```

### Reproducible: Verify a GitHub Release APK (Recommended)

This verifies the published GitHub Release APK matches the source code for the release tag (no keystore needed).

```bash
git checkout vX.Y.Z

# Optional: build a reproducible APK locally
bun run reproducible:build -g vX.Y.Z -m github

bun run reproducible:verify -a ~/Downloads/muajjin-X.Y.Z.apk -g vX.Y.Z -m github
```

GitHub releases include `reproducible-checksums.txt` as a release asset:

```bash
sha256sum -c reproducible-checksums.txt
```

**Note**: Your _locally-built_ APK checksum may differ due to signing. Use `reproducible:verify` to compare APK contents.
